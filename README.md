# airbnb-market-pricing-analysis
Data-driven analysis of Airbnb listings to uncover pricing patterns, demand drivers and location-based insights for short-term rental and hospitality strategy.
The goal is to support data-driven decisions around pricing strategy, occupancy optimization, and market positioning.

## Key Questions Addressed
- Which room types generate higher prices?
- How does neighbourhood concentration affect competition?
- Do pricing patterns vary across locations?
- How do customer reviews influence demand?

## Key Insights
- Entire-home listings command higher prices than private or shared rooms
- A small number of neighbourhoods dominate listing supply, indicating high competition
- Less saturated areas often support higher median prices
- Competitive pricing combined with strong reviews improves demand

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset contains 100,000+ Airbnb listings and is stored as a gzip-compressed CSV (`.csv.gz`) for efficient handling.  
It is read directly using pandas.
